# 03 — Backend

> Django app map, the DRF endpoint table (resource, method, required permission, flow served),
> the analysis/comparison engine as a queue-consumed service (contract summary — full spec in
> `05-motor-comparacion.md`), and the role/permission model mapped to endpoints. Data model
> and invariants (Ix) in `02-modelo-datos.md`.

## 1. Base reused

Kept from the template, as-is or minimally adapted:

- **Auth stack**: custom `User` (email login) + simplejwt, endpoints `sign_up/`, `sign_in/`,
  `google_login/`, `token/refresh/`, `validate_token/`, `send_passcode/`,
  `verify_passcode_and_reset_password/`, `update_password/`, reCAPTCHA, admin impersonation
  ("login as" → frontend handoff). `sign_up` is extended: it auto-creates the personal
  Organization and triggers the sample-project job (A1).
- **Conventions**: function-based views with `@api_view` + a `services/` layer holding all
  domain logic; triple serializers (List/Detail/CreateUpdate); explicit `path()` url modules
  composed per app under `/api/` (no versioning); settings split base/dev/prod driven by
  `.env`; pytest + factory-boy + freezegun test layout; `create_fake_data`/`delete_fake_data`
  management commands (rewritten for Versiona models); custom admin site; django-dbbackup;
  django-silk.

Justified deviations from the template (each solves a real gap):

| Deviation | Why |
|---|---|
| Parameterized DRF permission decorators instead of inline `is_staff` checks | Inline checks do not scale to 5 roles × 2 scopes × ~45 endpoints (see §5). |
| `DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS` (PageNumberPagination, page_size 25) | The template returns unbounded lists. |
| Throttling scopes on auth, upload and webhooks | Public-facing abuse surface. |
| `public_id` (UUIDv7) in routes instead of integer PKs | Anti-enumeration in a multi-tenant product (I12). |
| Huey → **Celery** (+ django-celery-results, django-celery-beat) | Fixed mission decision; the template's four operational periodic tasks (weekly DB+media backup, Silk cleanups) migrate to beat unchanged. |
| MySQL/SQLite → **PostgreSQL** (+ pgvector extension in migration 0001) | Fixed mission decision; FTS `spanish` powers B2. |
| FileSystemStorage → **django-storages S3/MinIO** for domain media | Fixed mission decision; `STORAGES['default']` is already the clean extension point. |

Removed: Blog/Product/Sale (models, serializers, views, urls, tests, fake-data subcommands),
`django_attachments` + `easy_thumbnails` (image-gallery oriented; PDF storage is a dedicated
`documents/services/storage_service.py`).

## 2. App map (bounded contexts)

Replaces the single-app monolith (`base_feature_app`). One line of responsibility each:

| App | Responsibility | Owns (models) |
|---|---|---|
| `core` | Shared mixins (`TimestampedModel`, `PublicIdModel`), default pagination, permission-decorator base, scoping helpers (`scoped_queryset`), StagingPhaseBanner. | StagingPhaseBanner |
| `accounts` | Template auth (sign-up/in, Google, reset, impersonation, captcha) + email verification (V2 wiring) + profile. | User, PasswordCode |
| `orgs` | Organizations, org memberships, invitations and acceptance (A1/A2). | Organization, OrganizationMembership, Invitation |
| `projects` | Projects, project memberships, versioned configuration and section owners (B1/B2/B3). | Project, ProjectMembership, ProjectConfigVersion, SectionOwnershipRule |
| `documents` | Documents, immutable versions, sections and stable identity, S3 storage service (C1/C2/C3). | Document, DocumentVersion, Section, SectionVersion, SectionLineage |
| `reviews` | Review requests, inbox, seals, validity chain, approval, D5 domain orchestration (D1/D2/D4/D5). | ReviewRequest, ReviewAssignment, Seal, SealSection, SealValidityRecord |
| `observations` | Anchored observations, threads, cross-version re-anchoring (D3). | Observation, ObservationAnchor, ObservationReply |
| `checks` | Check definitions (under pinned config), runs, results with evidence (E3). | CheckDefinition, CheckRun, CheckResult |
| `comparisons` | Comparisons between any two versions, per-section diffs (E1). | Comparison, SectionDiff |
| `engine` | The engine as a service: EngineJob, Celery tasks, PDF pipeline (PyMuPDF/OCR), matching — knows nothing about reviews/billing; extractable to a separate deployable later. | EngineJob |
| `notifications` | Notification model + **EmailTemplateRegistry** (new — replaces the template's f-string emails) + D5 selective delivery. | Notification |
| `billing` | Plans, subscriptions, limits, checkout, webhook, invoices (F1). | Plan, Subscription, PaymentEvent |
| `audit` | Append-only AuditEvent + `audit.record()` service called by every other service (base for F3). | AuditEvent |

Services per aggregate inside each app (template convention):
`version_service`, `storage_service`, `section_service`, `review_service`, `seal_service`,
`invalidation_service` (D5 pure core), `approval_service`, `observation_service`,
`check_service`, `comparison_service`, `billing_limits_service`, `notification_service`,
`audit.record`.

## 3. DRF endpoint table (MVP)

Prefix `/api/`. All list endpoints paginated (25). Routes use `public_id`. Permission column =
minimum **effective role** (§5); "—" = `AllowAny`. `⚙︎` = returns/relates to an async
EngineJob.

## 4. The engine as a queue-consumed service (domain view)

Full input/output contract, pipeline, queues and edge cases live in `05-motor-comparacion.md`.
What the domain sees:

- The domain **only** enqueues an `EngineJob` (payload JSONB) and consumes its `result` — the
  `engine` app imports nothing from `reviews`/`billing`, so it can be extracted to a separate
  deployable without touching domain code.
- Job states: `pending → running → done | failed`, mirrored in
  `DocumentVersion.analysis_status`; idempotent by `idempotency_key` (I15); retries with
  backoff (parse errors are permanent, no retry).
- Job chain per upload: `analysis → comparison(auto, vs previous ready) → seal_review(D5) →
  notify`, serialized per document via a Redis lock (edge case F4 in `05`).
- Celery topology: broker Redis; queues `engine_heavy` (analysis/OCR, low concurrency,
  priority to a new org's first version for A1 < 5 min), `engine_light` (comparisons),
  `default` (domain-transactional work: D5 seal review, notifications, re-anchor).
  `django-celery-beat` inherits the template's operational periodic tasks.

## 5. Roles and permissions

Org roles: `owner` (propietario), `admin`, `member`. Project roles: `admin`, `editor`,
`reviewer` (revisor), `viewer` (lector).

**Effective-role resolution**: org owner/admin ⇒ implicit `admin` on every project of the org;
org member ⇒ whatever their ProjectMembership says; no membership ⇒ no access, expressed as
**404** (not 403) to avoid leaking existence (I12).

| Capability | Owner (org) | Admin (org/proj) | Editor (proj) | Reviewer (proj) | Viewer (proj) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| View projects/documents/history/comparisons | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Download version (signed URL, audited) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Create project (org scope) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (as org member) | — | — |
| Create document / upload version (C1/C2) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |
| Request review (D1) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |
| Create/reply observations (D3) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Seal (D4) | ✓* | ✓* | — | ✓ | — |
| Confirm D5 seal plan (coordinator) | ✓ | ✓ | — | only if designated | — |
| Configure project: checklist/owners/rules (B3) | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — |
| Invite / manage members (A2) | ✓ | ✓ (org, or own project) | — | — | — |
| Billing: plan, payment, invoices (F1) | ✓ | view | — | — | — |
| View org audit events | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — |

\* Admin/owner may seal (implicit reviewers), but the seal's `signed_payload` always records
the actual role and assignment — probative weight is preserved. Editors do NOT seal
(soft author/reviewer separation; engine edge case F7 in `05`).

**Coordinator (D5/E4)** is NOT a sixth role: it is the capability `can_confirm_seal_plan` =
project admins by default + users designated in `ProjectConfigVersion.coordinators` (may
include reviewers) — DP-07.

**Implementation**: in `core/permissions.py`, FBV-compatible decorators —
`@require_project_role('editor')`, `@require_org_role('admin')`,
`@require_seal_plan_confirmer` — resolve the object from URL kwargs (project/document/version →
walk up to the project), compute `resolve_effective_role(user, project)` once per request
(cached on `request`), attach `request.project`/`request.org`, and answer 404 on
non-membership. Services receive the actor and re-validate invariants (defense in depth).

## 6. Notifications & email

- MVP channel: **email** + a minimal in-app inbox (`me/notifications/`).
- New `EmailTemplateRegistry` in `notifications` replaces the template's f-string emails:
  every email type declared once (subject/body templates, variables), rendered with Django
  templates; auth emails (reset code) migrate onto it.
- D5 delivery rule (S6): one grouped email per affected reviewer, zero email to preserved
  reviewers; review-cycle notifications are transactional and never rate-limited away.

## 7. Open questions (DECISIÓN PENDIENTE)

| ID | Question | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| DP-01 | Payment gateway for LATAM (F1): Stripe / Mercado Pago / Wompi / PayU / dLocal. | **Mercado Pago** behind a `PaymentGateway` adapter (LATAM coverage, mature subscriptions + webhooks); Wompi if Colombia-only focus; Stripe does not onboard CO merchants today. Operator must decide before It7. |
| DP-06 | Upload: presigned PUT vs multipart to the API. | **Presigned PUT** + authoritative `complete/` (hash, parse, limits); `UPLOAD_DIRECT_FALLBACK` flag for test environments. |
| DP-07 | Coordinator: new role vs capability. | **Capability** `can_confirm_seal_plan` (project admins + designated users). Avoids a sixth role and a matrix rewrite. |
| DP-08 | Withdraw my seal. | Allowed pre-approval only, as append-only event (see `02`). |
