# User Flow Map

**Single source of truth for all user flows in the application.**

Use this document to understand each flow's steps, branching conditions, role restrictions,
and API contracts before writing or reviewing E2E tests. Flow ids map 1:1 to
`frontend/e2e/flow-definitions.json` (v2.2.0) and to the founding-artifact flow ids
(A1…F1) planned in `docs/plan/01-alcance-mvp.md`.

**Version:** 2.2.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-08-13

> Maintenance rule (docs/plan/09 DoD #4): each vertical iteration rewrites the sheets of the
> flows it ships and flips them from *Planned* to *Implemented*. Acceptance criteria live in
> `docs/plan/01-alcance-mvp.md`; this map records the concrete routes/endpoints as built.

## Module Index

> **Status governance (updated 2026-08-13)**: the authoritative status per flow is
> `frontend/e2e/flow-definitions.json` (v2.2.0, 37 flows) + the flow-coverage CI report;
> the audit trail lives in `docs/audit/`. Every flow below is **Implemented** and E2E
> covered; the "(ItN)" suffix records the iteration that shipped it, not a pending
> target — the previous revision of this table still read "Planned (ItN)" for 15 flows
> that had in fact shipped and been covered since It1–It6, which this refresh corrects.
> Verified against the real routes/components/endpoints on 2026-08-13 (`git log
> --since=2026-08-02`): no flow was added, removed, or changed shape since the prior
> map (2026-08-02) — the corrections in this revision are metadata fixes (stale
> route/status/role text caught by reading the real code), not new coverage.

## Home Module

### home-loads

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Roles** | shared |
| **Frontend route** | `/` |
| **API endpoints** | none (static landing) + `GET /api/staging-banner/` (global gate) |

**Preconditions:** none.

**Steps:** open the root URL → the headline "El Git de tus documentos" and the sign-up CTA
are visible.

**Spec:** `e2e/public/smoke.spec.ts` (`@flow:home-loads`).

---

## Auth Module

Auth pages are inherited from the template and already functional (JWT + Google + reCAPTCHA).

### auth-sign-in-form / auth-login-invalid

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 / P1 |
| **Roles** | shared |
| **Frontend route** | `/sign-in` |
| **API endpoints** | `POST /api/sign_in/`, `POST /api/google_login/`, `GET /api/google-captcha/site-key/` |

**Steps:** form renders email/password + Google button → invalid credentials show an inline
error and no session cookie is set → valid credentials redirect to `/projects` (direct —
`app/sign-in/page.tsx` calls `router.replace(next ?? '/projects')`; see `auth-sign-in-success`
for the full session/cookie contract. Corrected 2026-08-13: this row previously claimed a
`/dashboard` landing, which stopped being true once sign-in started targeting `/projects`
directly — `/dashboard` today is only a redirect stub, exercised by `auth-protected-redirect`).

**Spec:** `e2e/auth/auth.spec.ts`.

### auth-sign-up-form

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Roles** | shared |
| **Frontend route** | `/sign-up` |
| **API endpoints** | `POST /api/sign_up/` |

**Steps:** form renders → mismatched passwords are rejected client-side → successful sign-up
returns tokens. From It6 on, sign-up also auto-creates the personal Organization and triggers
the A1 sample-project job (see `a1-onboarding-wow`).

**Spec:** `e2e/auth/auth.spec.ts`.

### auth-protected-redirect

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Roles** | guest |
| **Frontend route** | `/dashboard` (guard: `proxy.ts`) |
| **API endpoints** | — |

**Steps:** anonymous visit to a protected route → redirect to `/sign-in?next=`. Today this is
a double hop and the spec pins both legs: `/dashboard` itself hard-redirects to `/projects`
(`app/dashboard/page.tsx` is now a bare `redirect('/projects')` stub), and the
`useRequireAuth` guard gating `/projects` then bounces the unauthenticated visitor to
`/sign-in` before `projects-grid` ever mounts.

**Spec:** `e2e/auth/auth.spec.ts`.

### auth-forgot-password-form

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Roles** | shared |
| **Frontend route** | `/forgot-password` |
| **API endpoints** | `POST /api/send_passcode/`, `POST /api/verify_passcode_and_reset_password/` |

**Steps:** two-step form → request 6-digit code (valid 15 min) → verify code + set new
password.

**Spec:** `e2e/auth/auth.spec.ts`.

## Planned Versiona Modules

The 16 MVP flows (A1…F1) are specified with Given/When/Then acceptance criteria in
`docs/plan/01-alcance-mvp.md`, their screens in `docs/plan/04-frontend.md` §2, their API in
`docs/plan/03-backend.md` §3, and their E2E designs (including the D5 queen test) in
`docs/plan/06-pruebas.md` §5. Each sheet is written into this map by the iteration that ships
it (see the Module Index status column for the shipping iteration).

> This table previously listed the file names proposed at MVP-planning time
> (`docs/plan/06` §5), before implementation chose its own directory layout
> (`e2e/app/<module>/...`) and, in three cases, folded two flow ids into one spec
> file (B3+E3, F1+F2, and separately E4+E2 in `e4-e2-certificate-saved.spec.ts`).
> Every path above was confirmed against `find frontend/e2e -name "*.spec.ts"` and the
> `@flow:` tag constants in `frontend/e2e/helpers/flow-tags.ts` on 2026-08-13.
